# ML-zoomcamp2022
Machine learning zoomcamp, take 2

Goals for this time: complete two projects and more than 50% of homework, and get through the deployment section of the course. 

The datasets I am thinking of using for the projects are: 

Project 1. Geometallurgical variables https://lnkd.in/eMd6wSc3, found through https://lnkd.in/eKVBh2Ez; it would be great if someone could share a bigger dataset. Ideally, I would like to see if it is possible to predict important metallurgical variables based on the analytical data available for the ore samples. I am not sure if the datasets of this kind exist, because it is probably not possible to link the output variable (recovery of Cu in concentrate) to drill core assays and to the composition of the particles because of the complexity of the process. If I don't find the dataset, I will try to re-calculate assay data into sulfide mineral composition and will use content of bornite, chalcopyrite or something similar as a target variable. Any ideas about what target variable would be interesting to look at are welcome! The tasks for the project will include:

  * clean up the dataset (section 2.2 of the course), 

  * perform exploratory data analysis (section 2.3) 
  * try to understand the importance of the features in the dataset (section 2.11)

  * test regression, decision tree, random forests and XGBoost (section 6) to predict the target variable. 

Project 2. Prospectivity workflow from Transform-2022, https://lnkd.in/e4WFFVZm. 

Article:  I would try to see if it is possible to separate overlapping alteration styles in one of Scott Halleyâ€™s datasets from Waihi gold-silver epithermal deposit.

Thank you very much, Alexey Grigorev!
